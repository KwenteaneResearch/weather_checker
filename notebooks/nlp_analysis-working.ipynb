(ice just increased margins again)  though expanded, implied volatilities in the options market continue to trade at a steep discount, an odd quirk that was last prevalent with any consistency in the first quarter o f  2012.  in the news, reuters released a poll of thirteen participants with not one forecasting a surplus for the 2015/16. mean balance sheet estimates equated to a sizable 132,636 mt deficit with prices, again on average, expected to top £2100 and $2950 by year end.  with such a sweeping consensus, it is a  bit  surprising that prices have plunged approximately £ 330/$650 from their peaks  in less than two months.  blame the macro environment perha ps, but those are  ginormous downturns should those shortfalls actualize, but potentially valid  should they not.  options expiration in new york likely exacerbated the  volatility with the market crisscrossing  the 2800 strike tw ice in the session where more than 3,700 contracts remained open between both puts and calls. though the closing price, 2772, was safely nestled  between the two closest  strikes, a post settlement rally and last print of 2797 in mar6 leaves the window for some illogicals and perhaps an explosive start to the week – like  any other catalyst was really needed.  on a final note, commitments data fro m the cftc showed a 5,000 lots reduction in net length from the large  speculative category.  sourced from a combination of long liquidation and new short selling, net holdings in this segment have fallen to the smallest level  since april 2013.  one curious component within the report was the sizable presence of indexes that bought nearly 7,000 gross contracts over the volatile  period.  looking across the other commodities, indexes were buyers in 9 out of 12 reported products.  have a good weekend.

      "Summary: The cocoa market report for Monday, October 25th indicates that system related selling and discretionary fund liquidation drove the market down. The front month's system-related sellers eventually penetrated the market by day, electing multiple sell stop orders in the process. A selling vacuum ensued as speculative liquidation added to the downward pressure on prices. However, trade-related buyers prevented the market from breaking through its recent low where many potential sell stops could be lurking for the duration of the trading session. The latest report shows that the fundamental news front did not provide any indication of an imminent selloff, with an expected low arrivals figure in the Ivory Coast. Despite this, prices fell beyond an early double bottom on the weekly charts as momentum indicators slid just north of oversold conditions. New York was surprisingly the volume leader, with highlights including Mar puts and Dec call spreads. The latter traded at an almost volatility premium to the near strike, indicating a strong aversion to relinquish gamma.\n",

      "Summary: In summary, cocoa prices experienced significant losses during the past week, but managed to rally off their lows by midweek. This was due to value-based buying, short covering, and positive chart signals. Open interest remained stable throughout the decline, while volumes were extremely high. Implied volatilities also increased as a result of all the trading activity. The CFTC's commitments figures revealed that speculative length in net positions did not decrease significantly, which could leave the door open for further selling from this camp in the coming week.\n",

      "This chunk of text discusses the cocoa market report from Monday, October. It mentions that open interest and spreads were important factors in driving the market down, along with system-related selling and discretionary fund liquidation. The market found support at a certain level, but there were potential sell stops lurking. The fundamental news did not indicate a sell-off, and the net spec long position diminished. In New York, prices suffered even greater losses, with the front month spread plunging and surrendering a third of its premium. The inverted structure and short-term physical tightness were inconsistent with recent downward movements in flat price. The erosion on decmar compounded the overall market weakness and likely emboldened the systematic community. From a technical perspective, today's price activity was utter devastation.\n",

      "Today's price activity was extremely negative, with prices falling below recent lows and futures dropping beyond a double bottom on the weekly charts. Momentum indicators suggest a potential relief rally, but recent upward bounces have been short-lived as the market focuses on this season's potential surplus. In the options market, New York saw high volume, with notable trades including March puts and December call spreads. The latter traded at a volatility premium, indicating a strong aversion to giving up gamma. Volatilities on short-dated futures and options have converged, but March implieds were trading at a discount to historicals, suggesting a potential slowdown or mispricing.\n",

      "This text discusses the recent volatility in cocoa prices, which saw significant losses followed by a strong recovery. The decline was attributed to a poor macroeconomic climate, while the rebound was aided by value-based buying, short covering, and a positive chart signal. Despite the decline, open interest remained stable and trading volumes were high, with options trading also seeing significant activity. This had an impact on implied volatilities, which increased by about 20% on both the London and New York markets. The CFTC commitments figures showed a smaller-than-expected reduction in speculative positions, suggesting that further selling from this group may occur in the future. \n",

The daily chart shows a negative trend, but the weekly chart tells a different story.

In the US, there was a bearish price action on the daily chart, but a bullish trading of a call spread at a smallish delta. In London, the market was consolidated due to a battle between system-related sellers and trade-related buyers. Technical and trade-related buyers initially drove the market into positive territory, but it ultimately closed above the  day moving average. The pound fell against the greenback due to concerns over potential rate cuts by the Bank of England.

Reuters released a poll showing a consensus of a deficit in the market, but prices have still dropped significantly in the past two months.

The market is waiting for further clarification on next year's crop and is absorbing poor comparative arrivals data. In New York, the market gapped higher on the open due to technical buying, but commercial selling prevented further upside momentum. The spread between September and December contracts continues to erode, and there is a growing net spec long position in September. In the grading room, there have been  lots in the queue and  lots passing so far. In Brazil, arrivals were down from the previous year.```\n",

Even rarer –\\nin fact ornithologically speaking a brand-new species – the market was treated to the sight of origin buying today as a Bloomberg \\nstory winged its way across the newswires reporting the possibility of an Ivorian government purchase of 50,000 tons (not ‘tonnes’ \\naccording to the text) from farmers and cooperatives who are still long. It is true that when the wind blows even a turkey can fly and \\nmaybe  they  are  only  flying  a  kite but  perhaps  one  of  the  questions  any old  buzzard  might  ask  – there  could  be  a  few  -  to  those \\n‘familiar with the matter’ might be their intentions for the other 150,000 tons allegedly dotted around the place or where that falls \\nwithin the plans to ‘roll’ more than 200,000 tons of unsold main crop into the mid.  After that light relief, the fun stopped abruptly \\nas one’s focus returned to a London market whose non-descript performances of late – despite a nod in the direction of yesterday’s \\nbullish candle – continued. Pale volume is often a feature which develops in these stagnant scenarios and while it is not the only \\nharbinger, when periods of low turnover extend, they can herald a sharp move for which only a few are prepared. If so, this may \\nmanifest itself by way of thrusts out of some loose triangles (no doubt rationalised by the slew of grind data that is on its way), but \\nthose of a bullish bent – surely there must be some out there – should remember that markets like to fill gaps and the ones left on \\nvarious contracts on November 14th remain open. \\n     Given the recent pace of trading a quick glance at the settlements in New York would be enough for most to just as quickly look \\naway.  Yet under the surface there were some interesting trading flows that might be worth a few minutes of attention… hopefully.  \\nFirst, prices opened firm and spent the majority of the session trading about 1% higher testing a short-term ceiling that has been in \\nplace for the last seven sessions.  While the market has endured numerous rallies and retreats, as well as the opposite oscillations, \\nthroughout this latest stretch of range bound trading, interestingly today’s reversal came in tandem with a besiege of options trading\\nthat included more than 2,300 Mar21 2800-2950 calls spreads and nearly 1,500 additional 2800 calls.  Judging solely by the uptick \\nin  implied  volatility  and the  fact  that  each  continued  to  trade  the  same  price,  8  and  10 pts  respectively,  as  prices  fell,  both  were \\npresumably initiated from the buy side…again as prices fell a decline that continued throughout the 90 minutes that transpired for \\nthose volumes to transact as well as into the post settlement hours.  Perhaps it was just coincidence, tied to the positive inflation data \\nout of the US and the generally buoyant commodity sector in which cocoa has yet to participate, but the inverse nature of the futures \\nmovements  and  options  flow  was  curious.    Structure  too  landed  at  an  interesting  spot  after  firming  in  early  dealings  with \\nMar21/May21  trading  back  to  the  low  +$40s,  an  area  that  has  been  a  support  point  over  the  last  weeks.    Will  similar  strength\\nreemerge or will the uptick in exchange stocks and pending grading activity help move the pair lower?  Have a good evening. \\n\\nNEW YORK OFFICE\\nTODD C.

Even rarer –\\nin fact ornithologically speaking a brand-new species – the market was treated to the sight of origin buying today as a Bloomberg \\nstory winged its way across the newswires reporting the possibility of an Ivorian government purchase of 50,000 tons (not ‘tonnes’ \\naccording to the text) from farmers and cooperatives who are still long. It is true that when the wind blows even a turkey can fly and \\nmaybe  they  are  only  flying  a  kite but  perhaps  one  of  the  questions  any old  buzzard  might  ask  – there  could  be  a  few  -  to  those \\n‘familiar with the matter’ might be their intentions for the other 150,000 tons allegedly dotted around the place or where that falls \\nwithin the plans to ‘roll’ more than 200,000 tons of unsold main crop into the mid.  After that light relief, the fun stopped abruptly \\nas one’s focus returned to a London market whose non-descript performances of late – despite a nod in the direction of yesterday’s \\nbullish candle – continued. Pale volume is often a feature which develops in these stagnant scenarios and while it is not the only \\nharbinger, when periods of low turnover extend, they can herald a sharp move for which only a few are prepared. If so, this may \\nmanifest itself by way of thrusts out of some loose triangles (no doubt rationalised by the slew of grind data that is on its way), but \\nthose of a bullish bent – surely there must be some out there – should remember that markets like to fill gaps and the ones left on \\nvarious contracts on November 14th remain open. \\n     Given the recent pace of trading a quick glance at the settlements in New York would be enough for most to just as quickly look \\naway.  Yet under the surface there were some interesting trading flows that might be worth a few minutes of attention… hopefully.  \\nFirst, prices opened firm and spent the majority of the session trading about 1% higher testing a short-term ceiling that has been in \\nplace for the last seven sessions.  While the market has endured numerous rallies and retreats, as well as the opposite oscillations, \\nthroughout this latest stretch of range bound trading, interestingly today’s reversal came in tandem with a besiege of options trading\\nthat included more than 2,300 Mar21 2800-2950 calls spreads and nearly 1,500 additional 2800 calls.  Judging solely by the uptick \\nin  implied  volatility  and the  fact  that  each  continued  to  trade  the  same  price,  8  and  10 pts  respectively,  as  prices  fell,  both  were \\npresumably initiated from the buy side…again as prices fell a decline that continued throughout the 90 minutes that transpired for \\nthose volumes to transact as well as into the post settlement hours.  Perhaps it was just coincidence, tied to the positive inflation data \\nout of the US and the generally buoyant commodity sector in which cocoa has yet to participate, but the inverse nature of the futures \\nmovements  and  options  flow  was  curious.    Structure  too  landed  at  an  interesting  spot  after  firming  in  early  dealings  with \\nMar21/May21  trading  back  to  the  low  +$40s,  an  area  that  has  been  a  support  point  over  the  last  weeks.    Will  similar  strength\\nreemerge or will the uptick in exchange stocks and pending grading activity help move the pair lower?  Have a good evening. \\n\\nNEW YORK OFFICE\\nTODD C.
