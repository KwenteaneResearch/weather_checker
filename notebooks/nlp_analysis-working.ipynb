      "Summary: The cocoa market report for Monday, October 25th indicates that system related selling and discretionary fund liquidation drove the market down. The front month's system-related sell off eventually penetrated the basis, leading to a selling vacuum as speculative liquidation added further pressure. Despite no fundamental news indicating an imminent selloff, the cocoa market continued its decline due to weakness in the structure and physical tightness. The erosion on December 25th compounded the overall market weakness and likely emboldened the systematic community that embraced one sell signal after another. New York was surprisingly the volume leader with highlights including Mar puts and Dec call spreads, indicating a strong aversion to relinquish gamma due to multiple standard deviations in price movement and five different moves exceeding over the last trading days. Volatilities on short-dated futures and options have exhibited convergence, while mar implieds were trading at a more than discount to historicals, suggesting either a looming slowdown or mispricing.\n",

      "Summary: In summary, cocoa prices experienced significant losses and volatility during the past week, with value-based buying and short covering contributing to the price recovery. Open interest remained stable throughout the decline, while volumes were extremely high. Implied volatilities increased due to the trading activity, and the CFTC's commitments figures revealed that speculative length had not decreased as expected. This could leave the door open for further selling from this group in the coming week.\n",

      "Summary: The cocoa market experienced another day of erratic high volume trading with both extrinsic and intrinsic factors driving prices. Prices opened firm, sold off, rallied, and then skyrocketed due to realized volatility as indicated in the charts. The macro environment is blamed for the downturns but options expiration exacerbated the volatility. Commitments data from the CFTC showed a reduction in net length from the large speculative category with indexes being buyers of nearly gross contracts over the volatile period.\n",

The curve strengthened, and there was an undersupplied market on a final note. In New York, the market gapped higher but failed to gain steam due to commercial selling. Sepdec's premium eroded further with a growing net spec long position mainly concentrated in  sep. There were minor activities in the grading room, and Brazilian arrivals for the second quarter were down from the previous year.\n",

      "This chunk of text discusses the cocoa market report from Monday, October. It mentions that open interest and spreads were important factors in driving the market down, along with system-related selling and discretionary fund liquidation. The market found support at a certain level, but there were potential sell stops lurking. The fundamental news did not indicate a sell-off, and the net spec long position diminished. In New York, prices suffered even greater losses, with the front month spread plunging and surrendering a third of its premium. The inverted structure and short-term physical tightness were inconsistent with recent downward movements in flat price. The erosion on decmar compounded the overall market weakness and likely emboldened the systematic community. From a technical perspective, today's price activity was utter devastation.\n",

      "Today's price activity was extremely negative, with prices falling below recent lows and futures dropping beyond a double bottom on the weekly charts. Momentum indicators suggest a potential relief rally, but recent upward bounces have been short-lived as the market focuses on this season's potential surplus. In the options market, New York saw high volume, with notable trades including March puts and December call spreads. The latter traded at a volatility premium, indicating a strong aversion to giving up gamma. Volatilities on short-dated futures and options have converged, but March implieds were trading at a discount to historicals, suggesting a potential slowdown or mispricing.\n",

      "This text discusses the recent volatility in cocoa prices, which saw significant losses followed by a strong recovery. The decline was attributed to a poor macroeconomic climate, while the rebound was aided by value-based buying, short covering, and a positive chart signal. Despite the decline, open interest remained stable and trading volumes were high, with options trading also seeing significant activity. This had an impact on implied volatilities, which increased by about 20% on both the London and New York markets. The CFTC commitments figures showed a smaller-than-expected reduction in speculative positions, suggesting that further selling from this group may occur in the future. \n",

      "The text discusses the current state of the cocoa market in New York and London. It mentions the names of several individuals involved in the market, as well as key rates and trade settlements. The text also notes that the market is currently in a state of surplus, but the extent of this surplus is still uncertain. The daily chart shows a negative trend, but the weekly chart tells a different story. The text also mentions a news story about above-average precipitation in Cote d'Ivoire, which may have attracted attention from traders. Overall, the market is currently in a state of relative balance, but this could change quickly. There was not much else to report on in the market today.\n",

      "This text discusses the trading activity in the US and London markets, with a focus on the agricultural market. In the US, there was a bearish price action on the daily chart, but a bullish trading of a call spread at a smallish delta. In London, the market was consolidated due to a battle between system-related sellers and trade-related buyers. Technical and trade-related buyers initially drove the market into positive territory, but it ultimately closed above the  day moving average. The pound fell against the greenback due to concerns over potential rate cuts by the Bank of England. In the options arena, the dec put spread remains a focus with a large amount of trading activity.\n",

      "This chunk of text discusses the cocoa market report for Friday, February, focusing on open interest, spreads, key rates, volumes, and net changes. The report highlights the volatility of the market, with both intrinsic and extrinsic factors driving high volume trading. Reuters released a poll showing a consensus of a deficit in the market, but prices have still dropped significantly in the past two months. The market also saw a lot of activity in options expiration, with a large number of open contracts. The CFTC's commitments data showed a decrease in net length from large speculative traders, with a notable presence of indexes buying contracts.\n",

In London, prices have been trending downward since last week, but there was a modest rebound in sterling prices. The market is waiting for further clarification on next year's crop and is absorbing poor comparative arrivals data. In New York, the market gapped higher on the open due to technical buying, but commercial selling prevented further upside momentum. The spread between September and December contracts continues to erode, and there is a growing net spec long position in September. In the grading room, there have been  lots in the queue and  lots passing so far. In Brazil, arrivals were down from the previous year.```\n",

Even rarer –\\nin fact ornithologically speaking a brand-new species – the market was treated to the sight of origin buying today as a Bloomberg \\nstory winged its way across the newswires reporting the possibility of an Ivorian government purchase of 50,000 tons (not ‘tonnes’ \\naccording to the text) from farmers and cooperatives who are still long. It is true that when the wind blows even a turkey can fly and \\nmaybe  they  are  only  flying  a  kite but  perhaps  one  of  the  questions  any old  buzzard  might  ask  – there  could  be  a  few  -  to  those \\n‘familiar with the matter’ might be their intentions for the other 150,000 tons allegedly dotted around the place or where that falls \\nwithin the plans to ‘roll’ more than 200,000 tons of unsold main crop into the mid.  After that light relief, the fun stopped abruptly \\nas one’s focus returned to a London market whose non-descript performances of late – despite a nod in the direction of yesterday’s \\nbullish candle – continued. Pale volume is often a feature which develops in these stagnant scenarios and while it is not the only \\nharbinger, when periods of low turnover extend, they can herald a sharp move for which only a few are prepared. If so, this may \\nmanifest itself by way of thrusts out of some loose triangles (no doubt rationalised by the slew of grind data that is on its way), but \\nthose of a bullish bent – surely there must be some out there – should remember that markets like to fill gaps and the ones left on \\nvarious contracts on November 14th remain open. \\n     Given the recent pace of trading a quick glance at the settlements in New York would be enough for most to just as quickly look \\naway.  Yet under the surface there were some interesting trading flows that might be worth a few minutes of attention… hopefully.  \\nFirst, prices opened firm and spent the majority of the session trading about 1% higher testing a short-term ceiling that has been in \\nplace for the last seven sessions.  While the market has endured numerous rallies and retreats, as well as the opposite oscillations, \\nthroughout this latest stretch of range bound trading, interestingly today’s reversal came in tandem with a besiege of options trading\\nthat included more than 2,300 Mar21 2800-2950 calls spreads and nearly 1,500 additional 2800 calls.  Judging solely by the uptick \\nin  implied  volatility  and the  fact  that  each  continued  to  trade  the  same  price,  8  and  10 pts  respectively,  as  prices  fell,  both  were \\npresumably initiated from the buy side…again as prices fell a decline that continued throughout the 90 minutes that transpired for \\nthose volumes to transact as well as into the post settlement hours.  Perhaps it was just coincidence, tied to the positive inflation data \\nout of the US and the generally buoyant commodity sector in which cocoa has yet to participate, but the inverse nature of the futures \\nmovements  and  options  flow  was  curious.    Structure  too  landed  at  an  interesting  spot  after  firming  in  early  dealings  with \\nMar21/May21  trading  back  to  the  low  +$40s,  an  area  that  has  been  a  support  point  over  the  last  weeks.    Will  similar  strength\\nreemerge or will the uptick in exchange stocks and pending grading activity help move the pair lower?  Have a good evening. \\n\\nNEW YORK OFFICE\\nTODD C.

It is true that when the wind blows even a turkey can fly and \\nmaybe  they  are  only  flying  a  kite but  perhaps  one  of  the  questions  any old  buzzard  might  ask  – there  could  be  a  few  -  to  those \\n‘familiar with the matter’ might be their intentions for the other 150,000 tons allegedly dotted around the place or where that falls \\nwithin the plans to ‘roll’ more than 200,000 tons of unsold main crop into the mid.  After that light relief, the fun stopped abruptly \\nas one’s focus returned to a London market whose non-descript performances of late – despite a nod in the direction of yesterday’s \\nbullish candle – continued. Pale volume is often a feature which develops in these stagnant scenarios and while it is not the only \\nharbinger, when periods of low turnover extend, they can herald a sharp move for which only a few are prepared. If so, this may \\nmanifest itself by way of thrusts out of some loose triangles (no doubt rationalised by the slew of grind data that is on its way), but \\nthose of a bullish bent – surely there must be some out there – should remember that markets like to fill gaps and the ones left on \\nvarious contracts on November 14th remain open. \\n     Given the recent pace of trading a quick glance at the settlements in New York would be enough for most to just as quickly look \\naway.  Yet under the surface there were some interesting trading flows that might be worth a few minutes of attention… hopefully.  \\nFirst, prices opened firm and spent the majority of the session trading about 1% higher testing a short-term ceiling that has been in \\nplace for the last seven sessions.  While the market has endured numerous rallies and retreats, as well as the opposite oscillations, \\nthroughout this latest stretch of range bound trading, interestingly today’s reversal came in tandem with a besiege of options trading\\nthat included more than 2,300 Mar21 2800-2950 calls spreads and nearly 1,500 additional 2800 calls.  Judging solely by the uptick \\nin  implied  volatility  and the  fact  that  each  continued  to  trade  the  same  price,  8  and  10 pts  respectively,  as  prices  fell,  both  were \\npresumably initiated from the buy side…again as prices fell a decline that continued throughout the 90 minutes that transpired for \\nthose volumes to transact as well as into the post settlement hours.  Perhaps it was just coincidence, tied to the positive inflation data \\nout of the US and the generally buoyant commodity sector in which cocoa has yet to participate, but the inverse nature of the futures \\nmovements  and  options  flow  was  curious.    Structure  too  landed  at  an  interesting  spot  after  firming  in  early  dealings  with \\nMar21/May21  trading  back  to  the  low  +$40s,  an  area  that  has  been  a  support  point  over  the  last  weeks.    Will  similar  strength\\nreemerge or will the uptick in exchange stocks and pending grading activity help move the pair lower?  Have a good evening. \\n\\nNEW YORK OFFICE\\nTODD C.
